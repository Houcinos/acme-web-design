                        The group 2 is created after a long selection process made by <a href="https://hackyourfuture.be/" target="_blank">HackYourFuture</a>. Lien Arits took the initiative and the risk during the pandemic to travel all over the world and select the best 5 candidates to form this group. The members of this group are working day and night with almost no sleep to create the next generation codes for the future of the humanity.    
                    </p>
                    <p class="dark1">
                        The members of the group 2 know everything about coding. They actually invented the coding languages but they are pretending in HackYourFuture that they are learning how to code.

                    <p>
                        As coding is a piece of cake for us, we are trying to enjoy life in different ways. By way of example and without any limitation, we are attending the HackYourFuture classes every Sunday to see how other candidates are struggling to learn how to code!
